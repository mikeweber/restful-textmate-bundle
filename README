*RESTful Textmate Bundle*
  For now, this isn't really a bundle, but I thought it was better to get something published first, then figure out how to install it later. The purpose of this bundle is to give Rails developers a quick way to create a basic 7 action RESTful controller with built-in context based ID searching when appropriate.

*Files*
  _rest_
    This file contains the Snippet for generating a basic RESTful controller where only the model corresponding to the specified controller will be interacted with.  Most of the time, this is the Snippet you will use for a new controller.
  _nrest_
    This file contains the Snippet for generating a RESTful controller that belongs in a nested route.  The route for this kind of controller would look like this:
      map.resources :parents, :has_many => [:things]
  
  Both of these files create a before filter called _find_ that will find the object this controller acts as an interface for whenever the :id param is present.  The _nrest_ Snippet goes a step further and forces all actions in the controller to be scoped by a :parent_id.  So when an :id param is present, it will only search within the scope of the @parent instance variable.

*Installation*
  1) To "install" these commands, copy the contents of one of the files (_rest_ or _nrest_), then open Textmate and choose Bundles->Bundle Editor->Edit Snippets... (⌃ ⌥ ⌘S).
  2) Find _Ruby on Rails_ in the list on the left, then click the + symbol to add a _New Snippet_.
  3) Title the Snippet to your choosing.  I recommend "Generate RESTful methods" (or if you're doing this for nrest, "Generate Nested RESTful methods").
  4) On the right side of the screen, clear out the text box (Syntax Summary...) and paste in the code you copied in step 1.
  5) Below the text box, you should see input for _Activation_ and _Scope Selector_.  Keep the Activation dropdown on Tab Trigger, and in the text field, enter the name of the file you just copied from (_rest_ or _nrest_).
  6) Enter "source.ruby.rails" in the _Scope Selector_.  
  7) Close the window, and open a controller you want to generate methods for in your Rails project.  Type "rest" or "nrest" then hit tab, and follow the prompts.

*Terms*
  @things: This is the plural name of the object name you're interacting with.  When used in the context of the Nested Controller, it should be the name of the :has_many or :has_and_belongs_to_many relationship between your parent object and the thing.  i.e.
    class Parent < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :things
    end
  @parent: This is the parent scope of your controller.  All @things in your nested controller will be found within the scope of the @parent.  (N/A to _rest_ Snippet).
  @thing: The singular version of @things.
  ProperName: The singular version of @things in human readable form.  This is used for all flash[:notices] that may appear.
  Parent: The actual model name of the parent model.  (N/A to _rest_ Snippet)
